# weather-forecast

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quickstart
* add your openweathermap.org API key into the [config file](./src/config.ts)
* run npm start
* open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Testing
To run the test suite, run `npm test`

## Limitations/extensions
* openweathermap.org supports a language parameter - I could have used the browser language to populate this and return internationalised results.
